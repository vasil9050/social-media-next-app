Social Media Application

Overview

This is a full-stack social media application built using Next.js and Node.js. It supports user authentication, posts, comments, likes, and more. The app uses Clerk for authentication and Pinggy for exposing local servers to the web.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed.

Familiarity with npm (Node Package Manager).

Client Setup

Navigate to the client directory:

cd social-media-next-app

Install dependencies:

npm install

Note: If you encounter issues with package versions due to the latest Next.js 15 updates, use the -f flag to force install packages.

Start the client:

npm run dev

Server Setup

Navigate to the server directory:

cd server

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the server:

npm start

Exposing the Local Client App for Webhooks

Once the server is started, open a new terminal or command prompt.

Paste the following command:

ssh -p 443 -R0:127.0.0.1:3000 qr@a.pinggy.io

This will provide a secure HTTPS URL for the locally running client app (port 3000).

Configuring Clerk for Authentication

Log in to the Clerk Dashboard.

Locate your application and edit the endpoint URL.

Replace the existing webhook URL with the new one generated by Pinggy. The format will look something like this:

https://rncsr-2409-40c1-5a-9be4-d28-f8ff-f01f-8d3d.a.free.pinggy.link/api/webhooks/clerk

Save the changes.

Features

User authentication (sign-up and sign-in) using Clerk.

User profile management.

Post creation, deletion, and updates.

Commenting on posts.

Liking posts and comments.

Real-time updates for interactions.

Testing the Application

Ensure both client and server are running.

Follow the setup instructions for exposing the client app and configuring Clerk.

Access the application using the Pinggy URL or directly via localhost (for local testing).

Sign up or log in to test user flows.

Interact with the application to ensure all features are working as expected.

Notes

This application uses Next.js 15, so ensure compatibility with all dependencies.

The Pinggy-generated URL is temporary and will need to be updated if restarted.

Clerk is used for seamless user authentication and integrates directly with the backend for webhook handling.
